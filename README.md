# HPIS AR Feedback for Meta Quest 3

This repository is part of the HPIS project (Human-Prosthesis Interaction System) and focuses on prototyping **augmented reality (AR) feedback strategies** using **Unity** and the **Meta Quest 3** headset.

## 🎯 Objective

The goal is to design and test visual feedback elements (such as arrows, icons, and animated cues) that overlay the passthrough view of the Meta Quest 3. These visual cues are intended to support users in performing specific daily living activities (e.g., putting on a t-shirt, picking up an object) as part of an HRI (Human-Robot Interaction) strategy.

## 📅 Project Workflow

We use **GitHub Issues** to organize activities and track progress.

- Tasks will be divided into clearly defined issues.
- Contributions should be made in dedicated branches named after the issue, using the format `feature/issue-title` or `test/issue-title`.
- Pull Requests (PRs) should reference their respective issue numbers.

Gustavo is currently assigned to research and prototype the AR feedback elements.
